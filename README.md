A modern, dynamic restaurant landing page built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS3**, and **HTML5**. This project focuses on DOM manipulation and modular JavaScript design, ensuring that the entire page content is generated dynamically without manual refreshes.

## Project Overview

**Urban Spice** is a concept for a modern restaurant that blends global cuisines with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. This website was developed as part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum** to demonstrate:

- **Dynamic Rendering**  
  Using JavaScript to clear and re-render the `#content` div based on user interaction.

- **ES6 Modules**  
  Keeping code clean and maintainable by separating logic into `homePage.js`, `menuPage.js`, and `aboutPage.js`.

- **Web Design**  
  Utilizing modern CSS techniques like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and linear gradients for a professional aesthetic.

---

## Features

- **Tabbed Navigation**  
  Seamlessly switch between Home, Menu, and About pages without page reloads.

- **Detailed Menu**  
  A visually rich menu featuring starters, salads, main courses, desserts, and beverages.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Styled to ensure readability across different screen sizes.

- **Clean Codebase**  
  Modular structure using `export` and `import` functions for better scalability.
